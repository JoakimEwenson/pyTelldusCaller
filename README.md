# Simple Telldus caller
_By Joakim Ewenson (<joakim@ewenson.se>), written in 2020_

Small script for calling Telldus API and fetch a list of sensors and their data using requests module. You will need your own set of OAuth-credentials from the Telldus API to use this script. Fill in the blanks in the settings.py.txt file and rename it to settings.py and everything should work as intended.
